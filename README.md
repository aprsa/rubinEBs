## The LSST cadence impact on non-time-critical eclipsing binary science

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is slated to commence in 2024 at the Vera Rubin Observatory. One of the crucial parts of preparing the survey is the choice of observing cadence in an effort to optimize auxiliary science goals while maintaining the core project requirements. Here we look at the impact of proposed cadences, encoded in different operations simulation runs (opsims), on non-time-critical eclipsing binary science. This is particularly pertinent because LSST is the first large-scale survey that will provide us with color information in addition to high precision coverage of faint targets. We study the differences between the baseline opsim v2.1 and the 4 draft opsim v2.99 runs. We find that all 5 runs provide sufficient data quality to enable in-depth studies in the field of eclipsing binaries, and that there are no adverse impacts from any opsim modification studied here.
